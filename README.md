### What I learned

I started this project with learning the basics about project organization. This was a major goal to learn from my last project, which was severely lacking any sort of order or reason to why css was laid out beyond working on one component at a time. This time I wanted my code to be legible to anyone who came to look at my project so they could have a clear understanding of how the page was built. I believe this also is good to start practicing so when I build more complex pages, there will already be a structure that I'm familiar to work in.

I also wanted to have better control over responsive web-design and decided this was the project to learn on.


### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to add more interactive elements, and really play with pushing the animation of elements. I'd also like to work on smoother transitions between each media query by fully utilizing flex properties including stretch and shrink.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Organizing) - This helped me for project organization. I used this to start setting up sections in CSS. It has inspired me to look into OOCSS, BEM, and to later learn SASS.
- [resource 2](https://ogkcreative.com/development/8-html-css-tips-for-organizing-code-in-your-web-project/) - This is an amazing article that taught me about CSS variables and basic project organization. It broke everything down in a comprehensible way and provided examples to help with your own project organization.
- [resource 3](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-units-em-rem-vh-vw-with-code-examples/) - This was great for helping me understand responsive units and how they pertain to font sizes. It broke down the use of EM, REM, VW and VH while giving examples of how to use them.
- [resource 4](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) - This was a good introduction to the concept of BEM coding structures.
- [resource 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er1JEDuPbZQ) - simplified example of BEM
- [resource 6](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/battling-bem-extended-edition-common-problems-and-how-to-avoid-them/) - Problems to avoid with BEM
- [resource 7](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/oocss) - implementing OOCSS
- [resource 8](https://www.madebymike.com.au/writing/precise-control-responsive-typography/) - This is great for setting up more flexible fonts beyond using REM.
